# Bug-Severity-Prediction using LLM

This project explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to improve bug detection and severity prediction. Traditional methods for identifying, classifying, and prioritizing bugs often rely on manual intervention, making them time-consuming and error-prone. Our approach aims to overcome these challenges by fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs to automate and enhance bug classification.
